Xiaomi was founded in 2010 by serial entrepreneur Lei Jun based on the vision “innovation for everyone”. 
We believe that high-quality products built with cutting-edge technology should be made accessible to everyone. 
We create remarkable hardware, software, and Internet services for and with the help of our Mi fans. We incorporate 
their feedback into our product range, which currently includes Mi and Redmi smartphones, Mi TVs and set-top boxes, 
Mi routers, and Mi Ecosystem products including smart home products, wearables and other accessories. 
With presence in over 30 countries and regions, Xiaomi is expanding its footprint across the world to 
become a global brand. <hr>

Xiaomi is focused on being the most user-centric mobile internet company, and we aim 
to constantly exceed expectations through innovations in software, hardware and services. 
Many of our employees were initially fans of Mi products, before they decided to join us. Our team is 
not only passionate about technology, but also relentlessly pursues perfection to break tradition and 
push boundaries, all just to ensure that our products remain unique and offer an unparalleled user
experience. Xiaomi is headquartered in Beijing, China and has offices
in Asia-Pacific, India, and Europe.
